# Cat Clicker with Knockout

https://ethyl2.github.io/cat_clicker/cat_clicker_with_knockout/

This version of my cat clicker uses Knockout, which is available here:

http://knockoutjs.com/index.html

Knockout has handy features, such as

- observables
- observable arrays
- computed observables
- bindings

This version of cat clicker has a few more images than the mvo version, as well
as more choices for cat names. Also, it has an array of nicknames for each cat.
