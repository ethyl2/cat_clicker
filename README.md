# Cat Clicker

Four versions of clicking cats:

- Original: https://ethyl2.github.io/cat_clicker/indexOriginal.html

- "Premium": https://ethyl2.github.io/cat_clicker/indexSecond.html

- "Organized": https://ethyl2.github.io/cat_clicker

- "With Knockout": https://ethyl2.github.io/cat_clicker/cat_clicker_with_knockout/

-------------------------------

This is a Udacity project designed to give students practice in modifying a
web project as the given specifications from a client change. Also, the code is
later organized into model, controller, and view sections of code.

The first specifications included a cat image with a counter.

Later specifications added multiple cats and cat names.

The "premium" version includes a list of cat names, and upon clicking a name,
the corresponding name, image, and counter is displayed.

The "organized" version has its JavaScript code organized into model, controller,
and view objects. The model and view objects never interact directly with each other.
Rather, the controller acts as the go-between.

The last version uses Knockout to handle the separation of concerns.

### Other elements I added:

- image source links

- messages appear at certain numbers of total clicks

- random name generator
