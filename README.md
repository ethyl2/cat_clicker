# Cat Clicker

Two versions of clicking cats:

- Original: https://ethyl2.github.io/cat_clicker/indexOriginal.html

- "Premium": https://ethyl2.github.io/cat_clicker/

-------------------------------

This is a Udacity project designed to give students practice in modifying a
web project as given specifications from a client change.

The first specifications included a cat image with a counter.

Later specifications added multiple cats and cat names.

The "premium" version includes a list of cat names, and upon clicking a name,
the corresponding name, image, and counter is displayed.

### Other elements I added:

- image source links

- messages appear at certain numbers of total clicks

- random name generator
